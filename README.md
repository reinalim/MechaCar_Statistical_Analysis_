### 3. Adress the following questions:
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
There are no variables in the dataset that provides a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. The P value is greater is 5.35e-11, which is greater than 0.05 that indicates it has no significant impact on the mpg values, therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because allthe variables are proportional to the mpg values. 

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The linear model does not predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the p value of the multiple linear regression is 5.35e-11 which is higher than 0.05
